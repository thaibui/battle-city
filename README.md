# Battle City Game

My goals were to complete this game in a month. However, I never have gotten the
chance to actually finish it. 5 years later, I look back in time and say: "Why
don't I just put it online?". 

Play it here

Enjoy and have fun. Feel free to contribute or to use the code in your own ways.
